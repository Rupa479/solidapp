It will install 17,000 feet of new pipelines, upgrade key lift stations, and consolidate operations into a single, high-capacity treatment plant. These improvements increase capacity and reliability, reduce environmental risks and overflows, lower long-term maintenance costs, and prepare the system to handle future population growth and development.",
